# quote-machine

The random quote was my first attempt at working with APIs. It's an app that generates a random quote on design, by making an AJAX request to Quotes on Design API. I learned a lot about positioning elements with relative positioning, AJAX, jQuery, and learning about sticking to a project even when you're really confused and don't know how to even.
